# 🎬 OTT Platform Recommendation System  

## 📌 Project Overview  
In today's digital landscape, choosing the right movie or show can be overwhelming. This **machine learning-based recommendation system** helps users discover movies they love by analyzing their preferences using **collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches**.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Personalized Recommendations** – Uses **user ratings & behavior analysis** to suggest relevant movies.  
✅ **Hybrid Filtering Approach** – Combines **collaborative filtering & content-based filtering** for accuracy.  
✅ **Sentiment Analysis** – Analyzes **YouTube trailer comments** to improve recommendations.  
✅ **Machine Learning Models** – Implemented **XGBoost, Random Forest & Matrix Factorization**.  
✅ **Performance Optimization** – Applied **cosine similarity & hyperparameter tuning**.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Surprise, SciPy  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code  
- **Dataset:** [MovieLens Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/)  

## 📊 Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaned and merged datasets to ensure quality.  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Extracted key attributes like movie genres, cast, and ratings.  
3. **Model Implementation** – Built recommendation models using ML algorithms.  
4. **Evaluation** – Used **RMSE, MAE, and MAPE** to measure model performance.  

## 🔍 Results  
📌 Our **Random Forest Model** outperformed others, offering highly accurate recommendations with:  
- **MAE:** 0.3358  
- **MAPE:** 283,815  
- **RMSE:** 0.4397  

## 🎯 Future Enhancements  
- Expand dataset to include **real-time user interactions**.  
- Implement **deep learning-based recommendation models**.  
- Optimize scalability for large-scale OTT platforms.
